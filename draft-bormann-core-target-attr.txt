                     CoRE Target Attribute Registry
                 draft-bormann-core-target-attr-latest

Abstract

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply Web
   technologies to constrained environments.  One important such
   technology is Web Linking [RFC8288], which CoRE uses as the basis for
   a number of discovery protocols, such as the Link Format [RFC6690] in
   CoAP's Resource Discovery Protocol (Section 7 of [RFC7252]) and the
   Resource Directory [RFC9176].

   Web Links can have Target Attributes, the names of which are not
   generally coordinated by the Web Linking specification (Section 2.2
   of [RFC8288]).  This short note introduces an IANA registry for
   coordinating names of Target Attributes when used in Constrained
   RESTful Environments.

1.  Introduction

   (Please see abstract.)

   The original Web Linking specification Section 3 of [RFC5988] did not
   attempt to coordinate names of target attributes except for providing
   common target attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.  The
   current revision of that specification clarifies (Section 2.2 of
   [RFC8288]):

   |  This specification does not attempt to coordinate the name of
   |  target attributes, their cardinality, or use.  Those creating and
   |  maintaining serialisations SHOULD coordinate their target
   |  attributes to avoid conflicts in semantics or syntax and MAY
   |  define their own registries of target attributes.

   This short note introduces an IANA registry for coordinating names of
   Target Attributes when used in Constrained RESTful Environments.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines a new sub-registry for Target Attributes
   in the CoRE Parameters registry [IANA.core-parameters], with the
   policy "expert review" (Section 4.5 of [BCP26]).

   The expert is instructed to be frugal in the allocation of very short
   target attribute names, keeping them in reverse for applications that
   are likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use of their
   shortness.  The expert is also instructed to direct the registrant to
   provide a specification (Section 4.6 of [BCP26]), but can make
   exceptions, for instance when a specification is not available at the
   time of registration but is likely forthcoming.

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   Attribute Name:
      a lower case ASCII [STD90] string that starts with a letter and
      can contain digits and hyphen-minus characters afterwards
      ([a-z][-a-z0-9]*).  (Note that [RFC8288] requires target attribute
      names to be interpreted in a case-insensitive way; the restriction
      to lower case here ensures that they are registered in a
      predictable form).

   Brief description:
      a brief description

   Change Controller:
      (see Section 2.3 of [BCP26])

   Reference:
      a reference document that provides a description of the target
      attribute, including the semantics for when the target attribute
      appears more than once in a link.

   Initial entries in this sub-registry are as listed in Table 1:

         Table 1: Initial Entries in the Target Attributes Registry

   A number of names are reserved as they are used for parameters in
   links other than target attributes, a further set is predefined in
   [RFC8288].

3.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8288] apply, as do those of the
   discovery specifications [RFC6690], [RFC7252], and [RFC9176].
